## Original User Request:
I have empty project called Finance AI on Github. I am working with Jakob, so we are two.
I want to use VPN and create a server in my pc, where I can create two accounts of VM, for me and my teammate. 
We are going to use Visual Studio Code to modify, commit, and change the code for Github project.
I am planning to train AI (choose which the best), probable Generative AI with a given Data (Could you please give me some information where I can get the set of data related to client/user expenses and earning), based on this, a client/user can ask AI, it is worth to spend some money on this or he/she should save money for other expenses.
I am planning to use free & open Bank API to test myself. 
As for frontend, it is going to be very easy website with domain, probably we will be able to use GitHub domain for our project, what do you think?
The website will show the type of expenses, earnings as pie charts. Also, AI chat where I can ask him either I need to buy smth or not. 
Also, the website will have login form, where the user should put his information and bank account (It is going to be only me!!!). 
Probably, to save information, I will use SQL.
To secure the website, I am planning to use ZAP, dvwa.
To analyse the data: elk_elasticsearch.

Analyse this very carefully, and give me very detailed step-by-step guide. 

I dont want to use tsx or react js!!!
